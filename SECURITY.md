# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of DeviceSimulator with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in DeviceSimulator, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Public disclosure of security vulnerabilities puts all users at risk. Please report security issues privately.

### 2. Send an email to our security team
- **Email**: [Your security email here]
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] DeviceSimulator Vulnerability Report`

### 3. Include the following information
- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish by exploiting this?
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: OS, Go version, DeviceSimulator version
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands that demonstrate the vulnerability (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix it (optional)

### 4. What to expect
- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Updates**: Regular updates on our progress
- **Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

## Security Best Practices

When using DeviceSimulator:

### Network Security
- Run with minimal privileges (use systemd capability restrictions)
- Isolate on dedicated network segments when possible
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies
- Use firewall rules to restrict access

### Configuration Security
- Protect configuration files with appropriate file permissions (600)
- Store sensitive data (passwords, certificates) separately
- Validate all configuration inputs
- Use strong authentication credentials

### Deployment Security
- Keep DeviceSimulator updated to the latest version
- Run in containerized environments when possible
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures

### Code Security
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use static analysis tools (gosec, CodeQL)
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all external inputs

## Known Security Considerations

### Raw Socket Usage
DeviceSimulator requires raw socket access for packet injection:
- This requires elevated privileges or specific capabilities
- Use systemd capability restrictions: `CAP_NET_RAW`, `CAP_NET_ADMIN`
- Never run as root in production

### Network Simulation
- Traffic generation can impact network performance
- Ensure proper rate limiting is configured
- Monitor for unexpected traffic patterns
- Use dedicated test networks when possible

### Configuration Files
- May contain sensitive network information
- Protect with appropriate file permissions
- Consider encryption for sensitive data
- Audit access to configuration files

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Our Commitment
- We will work with security researchers to verify and address vulnerabilities
- We will provide credit to researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly
- We will coordinate disclosure timing to allow users to update

### Coordinated Disclosure
1. **Initial Report**: Private vulnerability report received
2. **Assessment**: We assess and confirm the vulnerability
3. **Development**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Release**: We release the fix in a new version
5. **Public Disclosure**: We publicly disclose the vulnerability with appropriate timeline

### Bug Bounty
Currently, we do not offer a bug bounty program, but we greatly appreciate responsible disclosure and will acknowledge contributors in our security advisories.

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes with security tags
- Email notifications (if subscribed)

### Update Process
1. Monitor for security releases
2. Test updates in non-production environments
3. Deploy to production as soon as practical
4. Verify the fix addresses the vulnerability

## Contact Information

- **Security Email**: [Your security contact]
- **GPG Key**: [Link to GPG public key if available]
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond to security reports within 48 hours
