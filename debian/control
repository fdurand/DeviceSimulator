Description: Network device simulator for testing and monitoring
 DeviceSimulator is a comprehensive network device simulation tool that can
 emulate various network devices and their protocols for testing, monitoring,
 and validation purposes.
 .
 Features include:
  * DHCP client simulation with configurable options
  * RADIUS authentication and accounting
  * IPFIX flow generation for network monitoring
  * UPnP device discovery and announcement
  * Support for multiple device profiles (printers, cameras, etc.)
  * Performance optimizations with connection pooling
  * Systemd integration with watchdog support
  * Comprehensive logging and metrics collection
 .
 This tool is particularly useful for:
  * Network monitoring system testing
  * Security policy validation
  * Device management system development
  * Network infrastructure testing
